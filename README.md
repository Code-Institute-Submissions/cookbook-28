## User Experience Design
--------------------------

#### Scope Plane:

  - What they say they need?

    The client wants to share and encourage other users to share cooking methods so that anyone and everyone can have a place to come too and find new recipes. The website is to feature images of the recipes and the methods and ingredients to making that recipe.

  - What they actually need?

    A intuitive website thats easy to navigate around and to minimise the required steps to complete tasks. The main page can have a list of the 5 most searched recipes, another page with all the recipes on the website, and another to add your own recipe. In this page, can be a form which will be self explanatory.

  - What they don't know they need?

    For it not to be complex in design. A good website is a simple functional website thats intuitive. A mixture of appealing images and short but descriptive content. I will also need to consider for the future to what constraints does the app have to perform within (scalability) i.e as your user base grows can your app handle the growth in traffic.
